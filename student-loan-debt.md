cant talk about rising debt without talking about the cost of college, public unievrsities blame it on state udgets, theyre taking on more adjunct professors, charging more in fees (the invisible cost of college)

colleges taking advantage of raising prices

endowments they can do aythign they want

Vassar, Harvard using endowment to make sure students dpnt take on student loans, paying for tuition for students who cant afford it, median debt at ahrvard, $11,000

public unievrsities and lack of money: 

layers if management is contributing to cost creep

how to interview students?
- the important thing is getting a representative spread of people, there are students who dont pay a lot for school and realize not all student have this crazy problem
