## SQL 1: Diving Into Databases

<p>Using SQL to dig into massive databases</p>

Relational databses:mutliple tables.

tables need to be connected somehow, every table has a key, thisis a unique peiece of information that you use to join to a different table

use structured query language to ask questions of a database

give sql wildcards to find stuff in strings, '%foot%' would find all inuries that have foot in the field, gives you evrry row with a value in injury that ahs foot somehwere in it ---- must turn off case sensitivity for this to work PRAGMA 

if younuave an or and an AND you need parenthesis, wanna keep ors sequestered in their own thing
