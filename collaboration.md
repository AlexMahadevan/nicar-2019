## (Generally) Painless collaboration with the greater newsroom

<p>How do I go about making myself more approachable and understandable to the rest of the newsroom?</p>

- Lunch and learn
    - Show how you did some of the stuff
    - Take questions, explain what goes into projects

- Grab coffee or lunch with coworkers
    - Chat about what stories they're working on and how data can fit into it
    - Brainstorm story ideas with them, takr them through the data mindset


- Compromise when necessary
    - 

- Navigating coworkers' exectations
    - Think we do some sort of magic
    - Think we take too long on something and don't want to engage
