### R stats

essentially, all mofels are wrong but some are useful

nothing wrong with linear regression, but might be giving answers to the wrong questions

regularlinear: each data point isindependent of eachother
what f we have multiple dsta points? school, hospital, location, multiple death rates for one hospital

individual trends may cntradict trends, 

gees

capture concepts of randome intercepts and random slopes

happy little data analysis: regular regression distinct ne

gees: can blend colors, rrealism

lme() and lmer() do something similar, but need stronger asumptions, stick to gee()
