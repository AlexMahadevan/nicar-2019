## (Generally) Painless collaboration with the greater newsroom

<p>How do I go about making myself more approachable and understandable to the rest of the newsroom?</p>

- Lunch and learn
    - Show how you did some of the stuff
    - Take questions, explain what goes into projects

- Grab coffee or lunch with coworkers
    - Chat about what stories they're working on and how data can fit into it
    - Brainstorm story ideas with them, takr them through the data mindset


- Compromise when necessary
    - Try to approach a goal from another angle if someone brings you a request that is clearly not in your wheelhouse
    - Or, if someone comes to you once they already wrote the story, try your best to add something to it (and gently remind them that it's better for me to get involved in the beginning of a project!)

- Navigating coworkers' exectations
    - Think we do some sort of magic
    - Think we take too long on something and don't want to engage

### Dealing with difficult reporters or editors

<p>

- They're starting to shut you out
    - Offer to make calls and help with the writing of a story

- Pressuring you to move forward with data being used inproperly
    - Limit your involvement with what you're comfortable with
    - Just bow out
    - At the end of the day you have to stand behind you data

- Behave with the expectation that data journalists are reporters
    -

### Managing deadlines and expectaions

- Treat your editors and reporters as clients, and treat your clients as two-year-olds
    - Twoyear olds don't have the words for what they want and when they don't get it they scream and cry, 

- Ask a lot of questions
- Bridge their expectations with your capabilities
    - Instead of a problem to solve, find the solutions

- Set up meetings with reporters
    - Ask "What data stories do you wish you had time for?"
- Target reporters who never use data in their stories
    - Get to know them and their work
- Be clear about how reporters should contact you if they want to work with you
    - In person? Email? Through my editor?
    If colleagues don't know how to reach out, they won't.

- How do you get buy in?
    - Build your ow inspiration folder and experiment with tech
    - Make a chart and find an example of the project you want to make
        - Codepen!!
    - Create functional prototype
    - Being prepared is key to getting your idea across

- How make sure you're on the same page?
    - Send out a weekly update memo
    - Talk to your editor about concerns with projects
    - Sit in on meetings between the reporter and editor

- How to find opportunitis for collaboration
    - Be bold: "What are you working on?"
    - Be the dreamweaver: make projects engaging and appealing in a quick and dirty way
    - Create opportunities! Meet with reporters to brainstorm
    - Go to other teams' meetings and figure out ways to get involved

- How do you foster your team's approachability?
    - Institute "data office hours"
        - Set aside two hours a week where reporters can brainstorm with reporters or troubleshoot a data problem.
    - Invote reporters to your team meetings
    - Don't be short with reporters â€” even if you're busy!
    - Schedule regular meetings with reporters so interest doesn't fade
